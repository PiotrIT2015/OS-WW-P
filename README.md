## General info
A simple OS simulation with desktop.

1. **WhiteDwarf**
WhiteDwarf is an advanced search engine project that expands upon the foundational concepts of a basic version I previously developed in Java.
The initial Java prototype served as a proof-of-concept during my academic studies and was successfully presented at several university and 
local tech conferences, showcasing my early work in information retrieval systems.
This current iteration, WhiteDwarf, is being developed in Python and aims to tackle more complex challenges in search engine design. 
It focuses on implementing more sophisticated indexing algorithms, improving search result relevance through advanced ranking mechanisms, 
and exploring efficient methods for handling larger datasets. The goal is to create a robust and scalable search solution.

2. **Witchcraft**
It is a clone of Youtube. To use it you have to download project 'RelaxationTube' from repository.

3. **PCAAnalyzer**
As part of the master's thesis, was created a web application that analyzes data from many files, ending a presentation data on the charts. 
There was implemented a statistical algorithm (PCA) for data analysis. Asynchronous communication, enabled by the framework, 
allows for the interaction of computer units and manipulation of shared data.

3. **PandasAnalyzer**
As part of the project, a python script was commissioned to compare CSV files. These are large files, up to several hundred thousand lines 
in length.

4. **NetworkMonitor**
I've always would like to implement this project in Java since the university. Unfortunately those days there wasn't such a great 
tools i.e.chatGPT . It is only a shortcut to run a file[*.jar] . 



## Running

**Microsoft Windows**

1. `winget install Python.Python.3.10`(via cmd)
2. add python to PATH
3. configure Apache and MySQL on XAMPP/Cloud
4. double click on `install-require-libraries.bat`
5. double click on `run.bat`

**Linux**

1. `sudo apt install python3`
2. `docker-compose up\down`
3. Apache: `http://localhost:8080`
4. MySQL/phpMyAdmin; `http://localhost:8081`
5. `./run.sh` (via bash)
